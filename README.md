# helloworld
   The purpose for this helloworld is setting up a demo project in fece detect embeded system. With the development of processor, more and more image process can be executed in MCU(e.g. ARM). The embeded system have usually one or more 1.0 Gz core, 512MB bytes memory, 8GB mmc flash and devices like network WIFI/wired phy, USB（mouse or keyboard or USB storage device）,  UART etc. The LCD is also used for human interface which usually have 800*1280 pixel or more.
   We want to setup a project which includes software component like Linux、QT、Opencv、Sqlite and hope to can be migrade to ARM/x86 processor.
